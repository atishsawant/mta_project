Problem Statement:

      WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) is an advocacy group focused on removing the barriers of entry for women in tech. They are looking to promote their next event and capture the greatest number of potential fundraisers and future advocates. Currently they are blindly using a street canvassing team to hand out invitations to their event. We will equip them with the data and learnings necessary to optimize their outreach efforts.
      
      Maximizing key audience reach is the primary focus for our analysis.  To achieve this goal, we will map out cosmopolitan
traffic patterns using MTA turnstile data as a proxy. By identifying busy stations as well as the height of traffic by hour,
we can focus canvasser attention on the busiest markets. This way WTWY can reduce wasted and inefficient canvassing efforts.

      The quality of the audience also matters to WTWY. WTWY indicated that they are also hoping to find people who would
spread the group's message. We are interpreting this to be the likelihood for donations. As suchm, we will focus our attention
on high traffic areas that index at high rates with affluence, professional careers, gender, and other demographic information
via census data. We believe that these are the types of people who would be most receptive to WTWY's initiatives and upcoming
campaign.
